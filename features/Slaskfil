Feature: Play Connect 4
  As a poor Connect 4 player

  # Some random scenarios (out of the many needed)

  Scenario: Creating a new instance of Game
    Given that a new Board of type Board is passed to Game
    When a new Game is created
    Then the value of Game input argument game should be set to that Board
    And the value of Game property matrix be set to an array consisting of 6 x 7 elements each with a value set to 0
    And Game tellTurn() be called using currentPlayer property with value 1 as input argument
    And the value of Game property playInProgress set to false
